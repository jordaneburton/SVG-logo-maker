# SVG-logo-maker
Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker utilizes Jest and the Inquirer node.js package to craft a svg file for a logo via the terminal. The application prompts you for information on various sections of the resume and then fills those sections according to your responses. In addition, some sections are optional to fill out since they are not always applicable. In short, this application is supposed to serve as a quick-and-easy all-in-one file maker for those important files that you don't want to create by hand!
